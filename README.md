# X Reply Grinder 📈

**X Reply Grinder** is a Chrome extension built to gamify the process of building distribution on X (Twitter). Instead of viewing engagement as a chore, this tool turns your daily 100-reply goal into a series of achievable levels, blocks, and rewards.

## 💡 The Philosophy

Building in public requires distribution. The most effective way to grow is through replies, but 100 comments a day feels overwhelming. 

**The Strategy:**
- Break 100 replies into **20 blocks** (5 replies each).
- 4 blocks every 30 minutes + 1 hour of deep work.
- Total time: 2.5 hours of replies + 4 hours of building.
- Result: You scale your product and your audience simultaneously.

## ✨ Features

- **The Block System:** Progress is tracked in small chunks. 5 replies = 1 block.
- **Gamified Rewards:** Earn confetti and sound effects every time you finish a block.
- **Ranks & Levelling:** Progress through 9 ranks, from *Reply Rookie* to *Distribution Machine*.
- **Focus Timers:** 30-minute session timers to keep you off the "infinite scroll" and on the "reply grind."
- **Visual Analytics:** A 7-day heatmap to track consistency and streaks.
- **Quick Logging:** Hit `Cmd + Shift + R` to instantly log a reply without leaving the feed.
