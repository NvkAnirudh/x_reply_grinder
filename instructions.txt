Build a Chrome extension called "X Reply Grinder" that gamifies daily commenting on X (Twitter).
Core concept:

User goal: 100 comments/day, broken into 20 blocks of 5 comments each
Track comments automatically when user posts a reply on X
Gamify with streaks, progress bars, and satisfying micro-rewards

Features:

Block-based tracking:

Each block = 5 comments
Visual progress: 0/20 blocks completed today
Show current block progress (e.g., "Block 7: 3/5 replies")


Gamification:

Confetti/animation when a block is completed
Streak counter (consecutive days hitting 20 blocks)
Levels/ranks based on total lifetime blocks (e.g., "Reply Rookie" → "Distribution Machine")
Daily streak flame icon that grows with consistency
Sound effect toggle for block completion


Dashboard popup:

Today's progress (blocks completed, total replies)
Current streak
Weekly heatmap (like GitHub contributions)
Best streak record


Timer integration (optional):

Pomodoro-style: 30 min reply session (target: 4 blocks) → 1 hr build time reminder
Notification: "4 blocks done! Time to build for an hour."


Storage:

Use Chrome local storage for daily/weekly/all-time stats
Reset daily count at 7 pm EST (user's timezone)



Tech stack:

Manifest V3
Content script to detect reply submissions on x.com
Popup UI with progress visualization
Local storage for persistence

Vibe:

Clean, minimal UI
Dopamine hits on block completion
Non-annoying—no intrusive notifications unless enabled
